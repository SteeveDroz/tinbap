# TINBAP

*Tinbap Is Nothing But A Puzzle*

What hides behing that recursive accronym? A game? A tool? It can be both, depending how you look at it.

In TINBAP, you only have one thing available: a transistor. Using that, your skills and your imagination, your can recreate a computer.

The first levels of TINBAP will help you create the basic tools, such as AND gate, OR gate, SR latch, and so on. After that, you will be left alone in a gigantic sandbox, in which you will be able to recreate the first computers. The only limit is your imagination (and your RAM).
